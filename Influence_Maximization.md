## Influence Maximization and Learning Papers

This file has a curated collection of research papers focused on influence maximization and influence learning within social networks. 
The repository organizes papers based on the type of data they utilize (e.g., real-world social networks, synthetic data), their core objectives (e.g., maximizing influence spread, learning influence functions), and the constraints they address (e.g., scalability, budget constraints, uncertainty in influence propagation). 
This resource is designed for researchers and practitioners interested in the latest advances in influence modelling, optimization techniques, and real-world applications of influence maximization.
